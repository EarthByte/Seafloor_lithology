This directory contains these files:

seabed_lithology_v1.nc – a COARDS-compliant GMT short integer netcdf file (GMT format #16) with 0.1 deg resolution
eabed_lithology_v1.xyz.zip – a compressed 3-column ascii file with lon, lat, and value (see list below)
seabed_lithology_v1.jpg – a jpg image of the seabed lithology grid
seabed_lithology.cpt – a color pallette file to plot the netcdf file using software like the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)
seabed_lithology_v1.kml – a Google Earth kml file of the seabed lithology grid

The lithologies in the netcdf and xyz file are coded by integers as follows:

1	Gravel and coarser
2	Sand
3	Silt
4	Clay
5	Calcareous ooze
6	Radiolarian ooze
7	Diatom ooze
8	Sponge spicules
9	Mixed calcareous/siliceous ooze
10	Shells and coral fragments
11	Ash and volcanic sand/gravel
12	Siliceous mud
13	Fine-grained calcareous sediment

The netcdf file can be easily imported into ArcGIS.  See here for an ArcGIS netcdf tutorial:

The netcdf file can also easily be viewed using the panoply software:
